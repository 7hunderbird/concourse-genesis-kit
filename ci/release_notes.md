# Bug Fixes

- Remote `meta.vault` definitions from the kit.  Genesis now
  provides that key, so the kit doesn't have to.

- Fixed a typo in the `gargen` property (should have been `garden),
  which lead to a series of fun exchanges of "RELEASE THE GARGEN!"
  here in the engineering team, but was otherwise harmless.
