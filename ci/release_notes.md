# Improvements

- Upgrade deployed SHIELD Agent to 8.0.7

- New `workers-only` subkit for deploying a satellite Concourse
  with workers that connect up to another Concourse's TSA.

# Release Engineering

We're trying out a new Concourse CI/CD pipeline for automating the
testing, vetting, and releasing of Genesis Kits, and this kit is
in the trial runs.
